# Godot Shmup

This is a simple shmup that I decided to work on after completing the
Godot 2D tutorial to help me continue learning about Godot, and also
because I enjoy shmups. PRs with suggested optimizations or
improvements are welcome.

## How to Play

Move with arrow keys or IJKL, shoot with F, special with S, change fire rate with A. Shooting generates heat, which dissipates over time. If you overheat, you'll have to wait until you cool down below a threshold to begin firing again.
